I'm Allison Ingram.  I'm from NJ.  I'm a second semester masters student in the Geography Department working with Dr. Henri Grissino-Mayer in the Laboratory of Tree Ring Science.  My research interests are dendrochronology and dendroclimatology.  I will be testing the temporal stability of different tree species at Norris Dam State Park.  I like running and working out, hiking and being outside.
